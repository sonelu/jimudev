# Jimu Robots Development
This is a repository with various information about some custom development for [Jimu Robots](www.jimurobots.com).

While Jimu platform provides some very cost effective solutions for building robots, there is almost no technical information available about the way the devices are built or how they work. Apart from the applications produced by [UBTECH](www.ubtrobot.com) (the producer of the Jimu Robots) for iOS and Android there is no other software support.

I find the platform interesting because it offers a lower cost than the Robotis Dynamixel servos, some additional and interesting components (the IR sensor, the LED unit, the Bluetooth speaker, etc.) that are lacking in the Robotis' offering and a slightly more convenient way to assemble the parts without the use of rivets or screws. There are though also a number of tradeoffs that you can read about in the docs section of this repository.
